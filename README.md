About how to pause Windows Update by using the regedit.

In the past few months,the Windows Quality Update has brought lots of bugs, some even affected the normal use.
(Such as the bug which breaks the "Start Menu" by the update patch KB4515384 and KB4517389)

To avoid similar things happend,I write this file (the file which is called "Pause Windows Update by using regedit"in the repository)to help others pause the Windows Update by using regedit.

**Attention:**
**There are risks in modifying the regedit.I will never be responsible to any problems after modifying regedit by this way.Please operate after ensuring you have enough knowledge of your computer and Windows**
